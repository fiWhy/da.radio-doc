# Achtung! Operators!

## [switchMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/switchMap)

![switchMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/assets/images/marble-diagrams/switchMap.png "switchMap marble")

>Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, emitting values only from the most recently projected Observable.

```javascript
import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

deferRequest.pipe(
    switchMap(data => deferRequest(`<api-url>/${data.id}`))
).subscribe() // resulting stream is result of the last defer request
```

## [exhaustMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/exhaustMap)

> Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable only if the previous projected Observable has completed.

Let's solve problem with 'clickers' and unnecessary requests.


```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { exhaustMap, delay } from 'rxjs/operators';

fromEvent('click', document.getElementById('#buttonId')).pipe(
    exhaustMap(() => 
        deferRequest('<api-url>').pipe(
            delay(1000)
        ))
).subscribe() // resulting stream will be the stream of request fired in last 1 sec after click
```

## [concatMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/concatMap)

![concatMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/assets/images/marble-diagrams/concatMap.png "concatMap marble")

> Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, in a serialized fashion waiting for each one to complete before merging the next.

If you want to just rise your requests one by one - your pick is ```concatMap```

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { concatMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

fromEvent(document.getElementById('myButton'), 'click').pipe(
    concatMap(() => deferRequest('<api-url>'))
).subscribe(console.log);

// subscriber will be notified by every response received one by one
```

## [mergeMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/mergeMap)

![mergeMap](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/assets/images/marble-diagrams/mergeMap.png "mergeMap marble")

> Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable.

If you want to just rise your requests concurrently - your pick is ```mergeMap```

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { mergeMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

fromEvent(document.getElementById('myButton'), 'click').pipe(
    mergeMap(() => deferRequest('<api-url>'))
).subscribe(console.log);

// subscriber will be notified by every response
```
