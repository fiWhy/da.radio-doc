# Operators

Operators are functions that help manipulate stream ```map(...)```, ```filter(...)```, ```merge(...)```, etc. When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observable. In the following example, we create a custom operator function that multiplies each value received from the input Observable by 10:

```javascript
/**
 * Example of map operator that returns new value depends on predicate
 */
import { Observable, from } from 'rxjs';

function multiplyByTen(input) {
  const output = new Observable(observer => {
    input.subscribe({
      next: (v) => observer.next(10 * v),
      error: (err) => observer.error(err),
      complete: () => observer.complete()
    });
  });
  return output;
}

const input = from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
const output = multiplyByTen(input);
output.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
```

Which outputs:

```
10
20
30
40
```

```javascript
/**
 * Example of merge operator that returns new observable which contains all listed streams
 */
import { mapTo } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { interval, merge } from 'rxjs';

//emit every 2.5 seconds
const first = interval(2500);
//emit every 2 seconds
const second = interval(2000);
//emit every 1.5 seconds
const third = interval(1500);
//emit every 1 second
const fourth = interval(1000);

//emit outputs from one observable
const example = merge(
  first.pipe(mapTo('FIRST!')),
  second.pipe(mapTo('SECOND!')),
  third.pipe(mapTo('THIRD')),
  fourth.pipe(mapTo('FOURTH'))
);
```

Which outputs:

```
"FOURTH"
"THIRD"
"SECOND!"
"FOURTH"
"FIRST!"
"THIRD"
"FOURTH"
```

Also every library has own implementation of operators - the full list of popular operators you can find by [this link](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/)
