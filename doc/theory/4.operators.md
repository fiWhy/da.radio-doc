# Operators

Operators are methods on the Observable type, such as ```.map(...)```, ```.filter(...)```, ```.merge(...)```, etc. When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.

An Operator is a function which creates a new Observable based on the current Observable. This is a pure operation: the previous Observable stays unmodified.

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observable. In the following example, we create a custom operator function that multiplies each value received from the input Observable by 10:

```
function multiplyByTen(input) {
  const output = Observable.create(function subscribe(observer) {
    input.subscribe({
      next: (v) => observer.next(10 * v),
      error: (err) => observer.error(err),
      complete: () => observer.complete()
    });
  });
  return output;
}

const input = from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
const output = multiplyByTen(input);
output.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
```

Which outputs:

```
10
20
30
40
```

Also every library has own implementation of operators - the full list of popular operators you can find by [this link](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/)
