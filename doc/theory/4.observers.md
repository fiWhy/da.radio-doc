# Observers

An observer is quite simple, in the above example the observer is the object literal we pass into our ```.subscribe()``` (subscribe will invoke our Observable).

```javascript
const obs$ = from(null);
obs$.subscribe(next, error, complete) // - is also valid syntax, but we’ll be exploring the object literal form in this post
```
When an Observable produces values, it then informs the observer, calling ```.next()``` when a new value was successfully captured and ```.error()``` when an error occurs.

When we subscribe to an Observable, it will keep passing any values to an observer until one of two things happens. Either the producer says there are no more values to be sent, in which case it will call ```.complete()``` on our observer, or we (as the “consumers”) decide we are no longer interested in the values and we unsubscribe.

When we want to compose the values returned from an Observable, before they reach our final ```.subscribe()``` block, the value is passed (or can be passed) through a chain of Observables, which is typically done via “operators”. This chain is what we call an Observable sequence. Each operator returns a new Observable to continue our sequence – also known as a “stream”.

```javascript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const obs$ = new Observable(observer => {
    let i = 0;
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        if (++i > 10) {
            clearInterval(intervalId);
            // observer.error('Push error!');
            observer.complete(); // Won't be fired if error occurred before
        }
        observer.next('Successfull push!');
    }, 1000);
});

obs$.subscribe(
    n => console.log(n), // success
    e => console.log(e), // error,
    () => console.log('Completed!') // complete callback
);
```

```javascript
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { takeWhile } from 'rxjs/operators';

interval(1000)
    .pipe(
        takeWhile(n => n < 10)
    ).subscribe(
        n => console.log(n),
        () => { },
        () => console.log('Completed!')
    );
```
