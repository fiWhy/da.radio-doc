# Observables

Observable is the core data type of Reactive Programming. An Observable is just a function, with a few special characteristics.  In Reactive programming, observer subscribes to an **Observable**. Then that observer reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable emits. So we can turn an array, promise, or iterable into an observable.


Here are a couple of ways one can create an Observable:
* create an Observable from scratch
```javascript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const obs$ = new Observable(observer => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        observer.next('Notification!');
    }, 1000)
});

obs$.subscribe(n => console.log(n)); // Will be called in 1s
```
* turn a promise into an Observable

```javascript
import { from } from 'rxjs';

const promise = new Promise(res => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        res('Notification!');
    }, 1000)
});

from(promise).subscribe(n => console.log(n)); // Will be called in 1s
```
* turn aany value into an Observable

```javascript
import { of } from 'rxjs';

of(null).subscribe(n => console.log(n)); // null
```

* or use a framework that does it for you behind the scenes, such as Angular.


Such as [HttpClient](https://angular.io/guide/http) service's request methods, that always return observable;
