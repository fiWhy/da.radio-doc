# Observables

Observable is the core data type of Reactive Programming. An Observable is just a function, with a few special characteristics.  In Reactive programming, observer subscribes to an **Observable**. Then that observer reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable emits. So we can turn an array, promise, or iterable into an observable.


Here are a couple of ways one can create an Observable:
* create an Observable from scratch
* turn a promise into an Observable
* or use a framework that does it for you behind the scenes, such as Angular.
