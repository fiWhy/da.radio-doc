# Reactive Programming

> Reactive Programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. —  **Wikipedia**

The hardest part of learning reactive programming is starting thinking in Reactive. 

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams. In a way, this isn't anything new. Event buses or your typical click events are really an asynchronous event stream, on which you can observe and do some side effects. Reactive is that idea on steroids.

ReactiveX or Rx is the most popular API for reactive programming. It’s built on the ideologies of the Observable Pattern, Iterator Pattern, and Functional Programming. Rx has libraries for different languages, but we will be using RxJS.
