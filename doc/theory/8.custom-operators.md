# Custom Operators

Operator in RxJs is just a function that takes `Observable` and returns new `Observable`

## [Guidelines](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/operator-creation.md#diy-custom-operators-for-end-users)
In the most common case, users might like to create an operator to be used only by their app. These can be developed in any way the developer sees fit, but here are some guidelines:

1. **Operators should always return an Observable**. You're performing operations on unknown sets of things to create new sets. It only makes sense to return a new set. If you create a method that returns something other than an Observable, it's not an operator, and that's fine.
2. **Be sure to manage subscriptions** created inside of the Observable your operator returns. Your operator is going to have to subscribe to the source (or this) inside of the returned Observable, be sure that it's returned as part of unsubscribe handler or subscription.
3. **Be sure to handle exceptions from passed functions**. If you're implementing an operator that takes a function as an argument, when you call it, you'll want to wrap it in a try/catch and send the error down the error() path on the observable.
4. **Be sure to teardown scarce resources** in your unsubscribe handler of your returned Observable. If you're setting up event handlers or a web socket, or something like that, the unsubscribe handler is a great place to remove that event handler or close that socket.

## [Pure function](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/operator-creation.md#operator-as-a-pure-function)

For example lets create an operator that will do the same logic as [takeWhile](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/takeWhile) operator with such predicate: 
```javascript
import { Observable, of } from "rxjs";
import { takeWhile } from 'rxjs/operators';

const obs$ = of(1, 2, 3, 4);

obs$.pipe(
    takeWhile(val => val < 3)
).subscribe(
    number => console.log('tick', number), // will log 1,2
    err => console.log('err', err),
    () => console.log('completed')
)
```

Our operator will get number parameter instead of predicate

```javascript
const stopIfMoreThan = number => source$ => new Observable(subscriber => {
    const subscription = source$.subscribe(val => {
        if (val > number) {
            subscriber.complete();
        } else {
            subscriber.next(val);
        }
    }, err => subscriber.error(err),
        () => subscriber.complete())
    return subscription;
});

obs$.pipe(
    stopIfMoreThan(2)
).subscribe(
    number => console.log('tick', number), // will log 2
    err => console.log('err', err),
    () => console.log('completed')
)
```

Or, if you want to use operator as observable method you can use it this way:

```javascript
/**
* For now we dont return another callback that gets source observable object
*/
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

function stopIfMoreThanMethod(number) {
    return new Observable(subscriber => {
        const source = this; // save link to observable here as arrow function doesnt have it's own
        const subscription = source.subscribe(val => {
            if (val > number) {
                subscriber.complete();
            } else {
                subscriber.next(val);
            }
        }, err => subscriber.error(err),
            () => subscriber.complete())
        return subscription;
    })
}

class CustomObservable extends Observable {
    lift(operator) {
        const observable = new CustomObservable();
        observable.source = this;
        observable.operator = operator;
        return observable;
    }
}

CustomObservable.prototype.stopIfMoreThanMethod = stopIfMoreThanMethod;


const obs = new CustomObservable(s => {
    s.next(2)
    s.next(3)
    s.next(4)
}).stopIfMoreThanMethod(2)
.subscribe(n => console.log(n)); // will still log only 2
```

Or you can pass method directly to the `Observable` prototype

```javascript
Observable.prototype.stopIfMoreThanMethod = stopIfMoreThanMethod;
```
