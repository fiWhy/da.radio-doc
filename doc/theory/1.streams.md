# Streams

>A **stream** is a sequence of data elements made available over time. A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a time rather than in large batches. —  **Wikipedia**

Alternatively, We can say that the stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time. For example number of button click(s) in 1 Second. So all clicks will be grouped as a stream.

Stream is a base unit in Rx.js or any other reactive library. We can create streams from:
- events
- promises
- different values
- iterable structures
- etc.

All operations in reactive programming work with streams, or we can say streams are like a fuel for FRP (functional reactive programming).

For example a number that goes up by 1 every second might have a stream that looks like:
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```javascript
import { interval } from 'rxjs';

interval(1000)
    .subscribe(n => console.log(n));
```

Or stream wich represents all keypresses for element:
```
[
    "D",
    "a",
    "T",
    "a",
    "A"
]
```

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

fromEvent(window, 'keypress')
    .subscribe(e => console.log(e.key));
```

And one more cleaner example - is an example of stream from "clicks on button"

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

fromEvent(/* element */, 'click')
    .subscribe(e => console.log(e));
```

Basically, almost every action can be represented like a stream.
